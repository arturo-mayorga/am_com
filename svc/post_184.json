This CD is hot! Arturo Mayorga\u2019s \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d shows an artist with powerful musical sense that translates into emotionally gripping instrumental pieces. As both pianist and composer, he enlists a number of talented emotions and fleshes out his arrangements with guitar, flutes, drums, oboe, English horn, violin, viola and cello. The mix is stunning. Two of the tracks are my very favorites. On \u201cMystery\u201d Mayorga\u2019s piano speaks elegantly and vibrantly perhaps of bravely and hopefully venturing out into the unknown despite uncertainties. The strings come in, not sappy, but giving an emotional panorama. I hope you\u2019ll give it a play. The other piece that amazes me is \u201cSerendipity,\u201d an anthem that makes me flash on epic films like \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d After the main theme is established, the viola (maybe violin) comes in sounding like an Eastern European folk tune. Then Mayorga tops it with strong piano and strings. What an exquisite track! Other tracks like \u201cEastern Pulse,\u201d the gorgeous \u201cOne More Day\u201d and \u201cWithin a Glimpse\u201d are gems. He ends the set with the only solo piano piece on the set, the lovely \u201cIf We Don\u2019t, Who Will?\u201d This is not the kind of new age music that you use as a sleep aid. It\u2019s intense, challenging, beautiful and ultimately emotionally satisfying. Enjoy!<\/p>","excerpt":"<p>\u201cHoly smokes! This CD is hot!
