As he did on his first album, Mayorga has included an interesting variety of musical styles and moods that demonstrate his versatility as a composer and pianist\/keyboardist. One of the eleven tracks is solo piano, and the others include guitar, flute, percussion and drums, wordless vocals, oboe, and\/or strings. Some of the pieces indicate Yanni\u2019s influence, but Mayorga is obviously finding and developing his own distinctive musical voice. Also an accomplished ballroom dancer, much of Mayorga\u2019s music is very rhythmic and danceable. Even the slower ballads have the dreamy sway of a graceful slow dance. There is a lot to like about this album, and I think it will do a great deal to expand Mayorga\u2019s audience and fan-base.<\/p>\n<p>Lucid Dreams begins with \u201cFind Me Again,\u201d a passionate love song with a strong beat and beautiful performances by Lew Tabackin on flute and Daniele Hager\u2019s powerful soprano voice in addition to Mayorga\u2019s piano. \u201cMystery\u201d is a sultry ballad that conveys deep emotion with a slow dance rhythm and beautiful melody; as always, Jill Haley\u2019s oboe adds an elegant touch. Haley also appears on the introspective \u201cLooking,\u201d conveying a sense of longing as she carries much of the lovely melody. \u201cEastern Pulse\u201d picks up the pace with an exotic beat and a variety of keyboard sounds in addition to the piano. \u201cReflejos\u201d has an energetic Latin flair with David Cullen\u2019s impressive guitar and Jeff Haynes\u2019 soaring percussion along with Mayorga\u2019s dancing piano fingers. Smokin\u2019! \u201cLatent Words\u201d is just Mayorga on piano with Daniele Hager\u2019s voice and Steve Holley\u2019s drums and percussion providing a strong, sensuous backbeat. I like the way this one sometimes resolves to a minor chord and sometimes to a major, making it a bit unpredictable. It\u2019s a beautiful ballad no matter which direction it takes. \u201cWithin A Glimpse\u201d is a tender, romantic love song that would be an elegant slow dance. \u201cIf We Don\u2019t, Who Will?\u201d is the only piano solo and overflows with emotion, ending the album with a sweet sigh.<\/p>\n<p>Lucid Dreams is available from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arturomayorga.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.arturomayorga.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Lucid-Dreams-Arturo-Mayorga\/dp\/B007R3BEZI\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/album\/lucid-dreams\/id514977457?uo=4\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes<\/a>, and CD Baby.
