Arturo plays the piano, but does it not alone \u2013 his desire to create something really big leads into the studio a lot of musicians, forming a band (guitar, violin, oboe, percussion, with their powerful groove, cool relief bass).&nbsp; Mayorga\u2019s talent quickly gets his special sound that is unmistakable, and who can not (and now the musicians are rarely forces on such large-scale \u201clive\u201d projects), it resembles many of the recent past.<\/p>\n<p>Arturo played the piano and as he demonstrates in the composition at the end of the album <a title=\"\u201cIf We Don\u2019t, Who Will?\u201d @ The White Plains Performing Arts Center\" href=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/?p=418\">\u201cIf We Don\u2019t, Who Will\u201d<\/a> that he could successfully play the album solo, pouring into the ranks of the many performers. He chose a different path, creating a temperamental blend of jazz rhythms, orchestral arrangements, folk music (it is true, most grain, which is enough to feel the taste of Spanish flamenco) and typical moves the so-called \u201cinstrumental\u201d music, it is difficult for an identifiable genre of \u201cnew age\u201d which developed such groups as the James Last Orchestra. And yet there is little from the soundtrack to suit the scenes, when feelings are exposed, and the passion with a head covering.<\/p>\n<p>The name of the album is \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d, it refers to the practices of New Age (which is among the supporters of such musical delights is easy to find loyal fans), but if he, Arturo, found inspiration in these border states of consciousness, then the listener to move to controlled levels of dreams are not <a href=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/?attachment_id=393\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-393\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-393\" title=\"Lucid Dreams - Cover Art\" src=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/183-6794075-6600956-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Lucid Dreams - Cover Art\" height=\"150\" width=\"150\"><\/a>threatened \u2013 there are too many speakers, sensual energy, sincere romance and emotion. Look at \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d and composition for a romantic evening (\u201cFind Me Again\u201d or committed a wonderful thing \u201cKnow It\u2019s You\u201d), and to set the mood (\u201cReflejos\u201d its a little naive-youthful passion). Well, if you like, when the melancholy covers the head and leads to pure catharsis \u2013 please, \u201cSerendipity\u201d, with its tormented soul of a violin, which I would call a gypsy.<\/p>\n<p>This is a bright album, a fascinating, long time letting go.
