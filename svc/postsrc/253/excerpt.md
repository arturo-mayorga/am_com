[Quoted](http://www.creationsmagazine.com/articles/C132/media.html) text below:

â€œMr. Mayorga has produced a fine album of original piano compositions in a gentle, melodic and romantic style, accompanied variously by strings, percussion, and synthesizer. Classical, World, and New Age influences are evident, and the pieces vary in mood, but are cohesive in their cleanly melodic style and superb execution. Debut albums can have an element of excitement, and Cascades has just that. A fine offering."
