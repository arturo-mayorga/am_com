Kathy Parsons from [MainlyPiano.com](http://www.mainlypiano.com) was kind enough to review Cascades.  [Here is what she had to say](http://www.mainlypiano.com/Older_Reviews_M-O/Mayorga-Cascades.html):

Cascades
Arturo Mayorga
2009 / Arturo Mayorga

47’29”
“Cascades” is the debut recording from pianist/composer Arturo Mayorga. Most of the ten tracks are piano with keyboard orchestration and embellishments, and several indicate a strong influence from Yanni. There is a variety of moods in the pieces – some are soft and romantic while others are darker and more powerful – indicating that Mayorga has a good range of styles. “Cascades” is a very strong debut even though it is a little heavy on the synth strings.

“Sunrise” begins the album with a hushed sense of mystery. As the piece evolves, it becomes more colorful and melodic while maintaining a mood of calm optimism. The title track picks up the tempo a bit. The left hand plays a flowing accompaniment to the lovely melody while gentle percussion and string washes in the background add dimension. “Painting On Silence” has a very strong influence from Yanni’s “In My Time” era – graceful, smooth, and melodic. “Lone Walk” is a favorite. Darker and more melancholy, this one reminds me of Dax Johnson in places. Piano, strings, and percussion are evocative and moody. “In-Side Change” is also on the dark, pensive side, and voices join the instrumental mix. It’s a beautiful piece, but I’m not crazy about the solo violin (keyboard). “Nocturne No. 2” takes a more classical turn and is solo piano. I really like “Secret Life,” which also has hints of Yanni. Upbeat and rhythmic, it is one of the more joyous pieces on the album. “Water Dance” is another favorite. A bit more ambient for the first two minutes, the haunting flute casts a quiet spell. Then the piano comes in, swirling and dancing. Eventually, the flute returns along with strings, creating a joyous celebration.

“Cascades” is a strong and promising first album from Arturo Mayorga, a musician who obviously loves what he’s doing. It is available from www.arturomayorga.com, cdbaby.com, amazon.com (download), and iTunes. Have a listen!
