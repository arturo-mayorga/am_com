<p>“Three years ago I reviewed the debut ‘Cascades’ of this musician, who was born in El Paso in 1981. His father bought early on a keyboard. Arturo stood watching in amazement when he lashed out a demo. He began his dream to even such an instrument to control, but piano lessons were too expensive. Yet Arturo did bravely, and fell into the high school in the school orchestra. He also studied and earned a BS in computer science and mathematics, and developed his compositional talent. Around that time began the early versions of songs to develop. Now his new project, and it was his most ambitious. He wrote everything himself, made the orchestrations, and produced the disc. It’s instrumental music, in which the piano Arturo paramount. Unlike his debut, he is less serene, but rather rhythmic.</p>
<p>This music is more rhythmic than the first album.</p>
