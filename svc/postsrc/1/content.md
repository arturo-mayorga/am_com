hyperion-renderer
=================
The aim of the project is to create an object-oriented 3D rendering system which abstracts the underling graphics API.  The Hyperion Renderer lends itself for use and implementation of different rendering approaches.  The client applicaton can provide a rendering strategy, select from a set of predifined strategies, or let Hyperion pick the best fit for best fidelity and responsiveness on the target system.
