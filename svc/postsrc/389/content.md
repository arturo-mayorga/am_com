Arturo Mayorga is a pianist/keyboard player and composer based in New York, and I am assuming he is of Latin origin. Lucid Dreams is his new album of instrumental music – there is a vocalist <a href="http://www.danielehager.com" title="www.danielehager.com" target="_blank">[the ethereal Daniele Hager]</a> involved but it is of the lyric-less accompaniment and adds an diaphanous element to the music. Now, as for the music itself, I guess you may want to call it ‘New Age’ for want of a better description, but I feel Contemporary Instrumental or even Contemporary Classical is a more fitting and apt description. The music, spread over eleven tracks, is melodically rich and utilises woodwind and strings to accompany Mr Mayorga’s keyboards. Guitar and drums add more colour and occasional flashes of rhythm. There too many musicians involved to mention them by name in this space, but the musicianship and commitment is high and the sound is very special. The music doesn’t feel like it fits a time or space within any musical genre – it does have a dreamlike aspect to it though. And it reminds me a little of the music of the British musician Richard Wileman and his band Karda Estra. Both of these composers eschew rock or pop pastiche and have developed their own musical language to the point where the musical language is unique. I think Mr Mayorga’s music is arguably a little smoother in style. The eleven tracks are: Find Me Again, Mystery, Looking, Serendipity, <a href="http://arturomayorga.com/site/?p=373" title="Eastern Pulse – Tango">Eastern Pulse</a>, Reflejos, You Know It’s You, One More Day, Latent Words, Within A Glimpse, If We Don’t Who Will? Lucid Dreams is an album that grows on the listener through repeated playing and is quality throughout. Highly Recommended.</p>
