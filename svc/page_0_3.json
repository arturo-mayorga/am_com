The 10 tracks feature keyboards and strings that just soar, and will easily carry you along for the journey. When you listen to the strings supporting his keyboard on the opener, \u201cSunrise\u201d, you\u2019ll fall in love with his talent immediately\u2026 he doesn\u2019t rush his playing at all, or burden your ears with over-emotive lines that often ruin a \u201cNew Age\u201d album for me\u2026 full of the spirit of loveliness. This debut CD came to be as he began production on something entirely different, and that natural flow is evident through all the pieces\u2026 the only note I would offer for future albums would be to add some live percussion \u2013 not that the percussives are \u201cbad\u201d, it\u2019s just evident that they would sound more natural if live. He also offers up some strong dynamics &amp; high energy on my favorite original, \u201cA Secret Life\u201d\u2026 full-bodied and definitely forward-looking. I give this one a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and will certainly look forward to his next effort. \u201cEQ\u201d (energy quotient) rating is 4.1.
