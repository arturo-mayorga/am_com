Arturo Mayorga is a pianist\/keyboard player and composer based in New York, and I am assuming he is of Latin origin. Lucid Dreams is his new album of instrumental music \u2013 there is a vocalist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danielehager.com\" title=\"www.danielehager.com\" target=\"_blank\">[the ethereal Daniele Hager]<\/a> involved but it is of the lyric-less accompaniment and adds an diaphanous element to the music. Now, as for the music itself, I guess you may want to call it \u2018New Age\u2019 for want of a better description, but I feel Contemporary Instrumental or even Contemporary Classical is a more fitting and apt description. The music, spread over eleven tracks, is melodically rich and utilises woodwind and strings to accompany Mr Mayorga\u2019s keyboards. Guitar and drums add more colour and occasional flashes of rhythm. There too many musicians involved to mention them by name in this space, but the musicianship and commitment is high and the sound is very special. The music doesn\u2019t feel like it fits a time or space within any musical genre \u2013 it does have a dreamlike aspect to it though. And it reminds me a little of the music of the British musician Richard Wileman and his band Karda Estra. Both of these composers eschew rock or pop pastiche and have developed their own musical language to the point where the musical language is unique. I think Mr Mayorga\u2019s music is arguably a little smoother in style. The eleven tracks are: Find Me Again, Mystery, Looking, Serendipity, <a href=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/?p=373\" title=\"Eastern Pulse \u2013 Tango\">Eastern Pulse<\/a>, Reflejos, You Know It\u2019s You, One More Day, Latent Words, Within A Glimpse, If We Don\u2019t Who Will? Lucid Dreams is an album that grows on the listener through repeated playing and is quality throughout. Highly Recommended.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about this artist, album and availability visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arturomayorga.com\" title=\"www.arturomayorga.com\">www.arturomayorga.com<\/a><\/p>","excerpt":"<h1>hyperion-renderer<\/h1>\n<p>The aim of the project is to create an object-oriented 3D rendering system which abstracts the und....<\/p>","title":"Lucid Dreams review by John M Peters","id":389,"url":"?p=389","categories":[{"id":0},{"id":4},{"id":5}]}]}
