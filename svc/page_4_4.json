However if he were to attempt this feat, I am certain it would be as graceful and dignified as what I have heard in his first classic New Age piano CD.<\/p>\n<p>Equal to his talents as a composing musician, Arturo Mayorga is nationally ranked in the competitive sport of Ballroom dancing, where Waltz, Tango, and Swing are scrutinized before watchful judges who watch for the accepted criteria of a dancing couple locked hand in hand. Now with a concert piano as his partner, Cascades embraces the identical movements found in classical dance by having a choreography timed with proper speed, motion, and balance.<\/p>\n<p>Like so many musicians, a parent\u2019s considerate gift of a musical instrument at an early age is what began his interest in music. Arturo states that it was at this early age that he realized the impact of what one person playing an instrument could have on another. Arturo continued music through high school then college. His scholastic studies were in math and science, but composing music was also on his mind so he started the framework songs for the Cascades album during this time period. While judging this CD for myself, I found the 10 classic piano songs of varying moods left me feeling they were a personal revelation of his emotional thoughts put to music.<\/p>\n<p>Cascades begins with first song Sunrise. This mid tempo piano and violin duet sets the standard for a graceful heartfelt ballet, where each timed movement is balanced by the piano melody considering violin takes a second seat by following the lead. There is much emotional content since a melancholy feel is present, lending to a touch of sadness, yet adding character and definition, leaving a beautiful image of what you have just heard in your mind.<\/p>\n<p>The Last Night of Winter aligns well with the piano\u2019s duo partner in allowing violin to take the lead in portion of the melody during this faster paced song, where full 360 degree rotational dance pivots, and those brief stationary pauses always see during pivot turns, can be pictured in your mind if you try.\nThe title song Cascades is a true champion in freestyle, where a faster tempo piano promenades with every rise and fall in piano key note steps, reaching the full height in posture, rhythm, and speed.<\/p>\n<p>Violin notes then connects with the melody posturing in a more formal manner while piano strokes sweep along the keyboard at a dizzying pace. The positive upbeat piano movements seem to sweep you off your feet at critical moments, leaving you breathless at the finish.<\/p>\n<p>Arturo is successful at engraving a full range of emotional content and movement into his classic orchestra style music. Cascades is a wonderful piano and instrumental album with beautiful rhythm.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing Arturo Mayorga\u2019s background in dance, one can easily imagine themselves sitting in the audience watching him in motion while listening to his music. From where I happen to be sitting, Arturo appears to be a winner.\"<\/p>","excerpt":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.newagemusicworld.com\/tag\/arturo-mayorga\/\">Quoted<\/a> text below:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cArturo Mayorga is recognized as a dancing pianist but don\u2019t get me wrong, Arturo does not literally dance while playing piano.

As he did on his first album, Mayorga has included an interesting variety of musical styles and moods that demonstrate his versatility as a composer and pianist\/keyboardist. One of the eleven tracks is solo piano, and the others include guitar, flute, percussion and drums, wordless vocals, oboe, and\/or strings. Some of the pieces indicate Yanni\u2019s influence, but Mayorga is obviously finding and developing his own distinctive musical voice. Also an accomplished ballroom dancer, much of Mayorga\u2019s music is very rhythmic and danceable. Even the slower ballads have the dreamy sway of a graceful slow dance. There is a lot to like about this album, and I think it will do a great deal to expand Mayorga\u2019s audience and fan-base.<\/p>\n<p>Lucid Dreams begins with \u201cFind Me Again,\u201d a passionate love song with a strong beat and beautiful performances by Lew Tabackin on flute and Daniele Hager\u2019s powerful soprano voice in addition to Mayorga\u2019s piano. \u201cMystery\u201d is a sultry ballad that conveys deep emotion with a slow dance rhythm and beautiful melody; as always, Jill Haley\u2019s oboe adds an elegant touch. Haley also appears on the introspective \u201cLooking,\u201d conveying a sense of longing as she carries much of the lovely melody. \u201cEastern Pulse\u201d picks up the pace with an exotic beat and a variety of keyboard sounds in addition to the piano. \u201cReflejos\u201d has an energetic Latin flair with David Cullen\u2019s impressive guitar and Jeff Haynes\u2019 soaring percussion along with Mayorga\u2019s dancing piano fingers. Smokin\u2019! \u201cLatent Words\u201d is just Mayorga on piano with Daniele Hager\u2019s voice and Steve Holley\u2019s drums and percussion providing a strong, sensuous backbeat. I like the way this one sometimes resolves to a minor chord and sometimes to a major, making it a bit unpredictable. It\u2019s a beautiful ballad no matter which direction it takes. \u201cWithin A Glimpse\u201d is a tender, romantic love song that would be an elegant slow dance. \u201cIf We Don\u2019t, Who Will?\u201d is the only piano solo and overflows with emotion, ending the album with a sweet sigh.<\/p>\n<p>Lucid Dreams is available from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arturomayorga.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.arturomayorga.com<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Lucid-Dreams-Arturo-Mayorga\/dp\/B007R3BEZI\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/album\/lucid-dreams\/id514977457?uo=4\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes<\/a>, and CD Baby.

His father bought early on a keyboard. Arturo stood watching in amazement when he lashed out a demo. He began his dream to even such an instrument to control, but piano lessons were too expensive. Yet Arturo did bravely, and fell into the high school in the school orchestra. He also studied and earned a BS in computer science and mathematics, and developed his compositional talent. Around that time began the early versions of songs to develop. Now his new project, and it was his most ambitious. He wrote everything himself, made the orchestrations, and produced the disc. It\u2019s instrumental music, in which the piano Arturo paramount. Unlike his debut, he is less serene, but rather rhythmic.<\/p>\n<p>This music is more rhythmic than the first album.<\/p>\n<p>Patrick Van de Wiele (3 to 4)<\/p>","excerpt":"<h1>hyperion-renderer<\/h1>\n<p>The aim of the project is to create an object-oriented 3D rendering system which abstracts the und....<\/p>","title":"Keys & Chords Review of Lucid Dreams","id":186,"url":"?p=186","categories":[{"id":0},{"id":4},{"id":5}]}]}
