Arturo plays the piano, but does it not alone \u2013 his desire to create something really big leads into the studio a lot of musicians, forming a band (guitar, violin, oboe, percussion, with their powerful groove, cool relief bass).&nbsp; Mayorga\u2019s talent quickly gets his special sound that is unmistakable, and who can not (and now the musicians are rarely forces on such large-scale \u201clive\u201d projects), it resembles many of the recent past.<\/p>\n<p>Arturo played the piano and as he demonstrates in the composition at the end of the album <a title=\"\u201cIf We Don\u2019t, Who Will?\u201d @ The White Plains Performing Arts Center\" href=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/?p=418\">\u201cIf We Don\u2019t, Who Will\u201d<\/a> that he could successfully play the album solo, pouring into the ranks of the many performers. He chose a different path, creating a temperamental blend of jazz rhythms, orchestral arrangements, folk music (it is true, most grain, which is enough to feel the taste of Spanish flamenco) and typical moves the so-called \u201cinstrumental\u201d music, it is difficult for an identifiable genre of \u201cnew age\u201d which developed such groups as the James Last Orchestra. And yet there is little from the soundtrack to suit the scenes, when feelings are exposed, and the passion with a head covering.<\/p>\n<p>The name of the album is \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d, it refers to the practices of New Age (which is among the supporters of such musical delights is easy to find loyal fans), but if he, Arturo, found inspiration in these border states of consciousness, then the listener to move to controlled levels of dreams are not <a href=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/?attachment_id=393\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-393\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-393\" title=\"Lucid Dreams - Cover Art\" src=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/183-6794075-6600956-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Lucid Dreams - Cover Art\" height=\"150\" width=\"150\"><\/a>threatened \u2013 there are too many speakers, sensual energy, sincere romance and emotion. Look at \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d and composition for a romantic evening (\u201cFind Me Again\u201d or committed a wonderful thing \u201cKnow It\u2019s You\u201d), and to set the mood (\u201cReflejos\u201d its a little naive-youthful passion). Well, if you like, when the melancholy covers the head and leads to pure catharsis \u2013 please, \u201cSerendipity\u201d, with its tormented soul of a violin, which I would call a gypsy.<\/p>\n<p>This is a bright album, a fascinating, long time letting go.

It\u2019s also a long way from being a youngster where \u201cpiano lessons were not within reach,\u201d to becoming an accomplished keyboardist playing along side some major league talent. As time went on, despite the lack of formal training, by the age of 14 he \u201chad begun to see patterns in rhythm and harmony along with their consequent emotional effects.\u201d It was during his time in high school orchestra that he learned how different instruments come together to produce complex sounds, which sparked a desire within him to write his own music.<\/p>\n<p>Although music remained near and dear to his heart, when it came time to go to college, he choose to study math and computer science \u2013 although not surprising coming from a family of engineers. His training has given him opportunities to work with a number of high tech companies including NASA. This interest in technology led him to learning about the recording process and he eventually released his first CD entitled Cascades, which received favorable reviews.<\/p>\n<p>His follow up album and latest release, Lucid Dreams, takes it to the next level. Arturo chose to work with one of the finest producer\/ engineers available: &nbsp;Grammy-award winner Corin Nelsen, who I am quite familiar with from his work with Windham Hill founder Will Ackerman among other projects. There are a number of other notable names on Lucid Dreams as well. I was impressed to see flute and sax-man, Lew Tabackin who has played with some of the biggest stars in jazz, both in big bands and small ensembles. I also recognized percussionist Jeff Haynes from The Pat Metheney Group. Another veteran of Will Ackerman studio sessions is Jill Haley on English horn and oboe. A number of other fine musicians, including the Attacca String Quartet, add their talents as well.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/?attachment_id=429\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-429\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-429\" title=\"Headshot BW\" src=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/mail-5-99x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" height=\"150\" width=\"99\"><\/a>Airy flute and ambient synthesizer sounds create an atmospheric intro to the first track, entitled \u201cFind Me Again.\u201d &nbsp;The mood soon shifts as conga drums lay down a groove and Arturo\u2019s piano takes command. I\u2019m not sure exactly what it is about the chord progression he is playing, but I found it quite compelling. (A sample of this track, and others, can be found on the <a title=\"Music\" href=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/?page_id=2\">\u201cMusic\u201d<\/a> page of his website.) This is followed by a composition called \u201cMystery\u201d that with its lush orchestration and blend of classical and new age overtones reminded me a bit of Yanni. After the relatively calm and pastoral feel of \u201cLooking\u201d with its wistful oboe melody, the grandeur, passion, and drama of the next track, \u201cSerendipity\u201d created a yin\/yang contrast. This piece, which features the string quartet, could work quite well as a film soundtrack.<\/p>\n<p>A standout track, for me, is the upbeat Latin-tinged \u201cReflejos\u201d which showcases the tasteful Spanish guitar playing of David Cullen. In another yin\/yang comparison, the following track, \u201cYou Know It\u2019s You,\u201d is a lovely ballad that highlights Arturo\u2019s skill as an arranger. I also very much enjoyed the next to the last track entitled \u201cWithin A Glimpse\u201d which begins with solo piano and adds other instruments as it evolves, building in depth and complexity before coming back to the solo piano at the end. In addition to Arturo\u2019s flair for arranging, I\u2019m also quite impressed with his skill as a pianist and his ability to play with grace and subtlety as well as with tremendous power and passion. It seems that I\u2019m not the only one who finds a lot to like in Arturo\u2019s music, asLucid Dreams opened in the top spot for the April 2012 ZMR Top 100 radio charts. I believe that he has chosen wisely in working with a top-flight producer\/engineer and highly talented accompanists to bring out the shine and sparkle of his well-conceived compositions. If Lucid Dreams is any indication, I\u2019m sure there will be many more sweet dreams in Arturo\u2019s future.<a href=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/?attachment_id=428\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-428\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-428\" title=\"High-rise Piano\" src=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/site-150x111.jpg\" alt=\"\" height=\"111\" width=\"150\"><\/a><\/p>","excerpt":"<h1>hyperion-renderer<\/h1>\n<p>The aim of the project is to create an object-oriented 3D rendering system which abstracts the und....<\/p>","title":"Review from Music & Media Focus - Lucid Dreams","id":434,"url":"?p=434","categories":[{"id":0},{"id":4},{"id":5}]}]}
