His father bought early on a keyboard. Arturo stood watching in amazement when he lashed out a demo. He began his dream to even such an instrument to control, but piano lessons were too expensive. Yet Arturo did bravely, and fell into the high school in the school orchestra. He also studied and earned a BS in computer science and mathematics, and developed his compositional talent. Around that time began the early versions of songs to develop. Now his new project, and it was his most ambitious. He wrote everything himself, made the orchestrations, and produced the disc. It\u2019s instrumental music, in which the piano Arturo paramount. Unlike his debut, he is less serene, but rather rhythmic.<\/p>\n<p>This music is more rhythmic than the first album.<\/p>\n<p>Patrick Van de Wiele (3 to 4)<\/p>","excerpt":"<p>\u201cThree years ago I reviewed the debut \u2018Cascades\u2019 of this musician, who was born in El Paso in 1981.

This CD is hot! Arturo Mayorga\u2019s \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d shows an artist with powerful musical sense that translates into emotionally gripping instrumental pieces. As both pianist and composer, he enlists a number of talented emotions and fleshes out his arrangements with guitar, flutes, drums, oboe, English horn, violin, viola and cello. The mix is stunning. Two of the tracks are my very favorites. On \u201cMystery\u201d Mayorga\u2019s piano speaks elegantly and vibrantly perhaps of bravely and hopefully venturing out into the unknown despite uncertainties. The strings come in, not sappy, but giving an emotional panorama. I hope you\u2019ll give it a play. The other piece that amazes me is \u201cSerendipity,\u201d an anthem that makes me flash on epic films like \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d After the main theme is established, the viola (maybe violin) comes in sounding like an Eastern European folk tune. Then Mayorga tops it with strong piano and strings. What an exquisite track! Other tracks like \u201cEastern Pulse,\u201d the gorgeous \u201cOne More Day\u201d and \u201cWithin a Glimpse\u201d are gems. He ends the set with the only solo piano piece on the set, the lovely \u201cIf We Don\u2019t, Who Will?\u201d This is not the kind of new age music that you use as a sleep aid. It\u2019s intense, challenging, beautiful and ultimately emotionally satisfying. Enjoy!<\/p>","excerpt":"<p>\u201cHoly smokes! This CD is hot!

Most of the ten tracks are piano with keyboard orchestration and embellishments, and several indicate a strong influence from Yanni. There is a variety of moods in the pieces \u2013 some are soft and romantic while others are darker and more powerful \u2013 indicating that Mayorga has a good range of styles. \u201cCascades\u201d is a very strong debut even though it is a little heavy on the synth strings.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSunrise\u201d begins the album with a hushed sense of mystery. As the piece evolves, it becomes more colorful and melodic while maintaining a mood of calm optimism. The title track picks up the tempo a bit. The left hand plays a flowing accompaniment to the lovely melody while gentle percussion and string washes in the background add dimension. \u201cPainting On Silence\u201d has a very strong influence from Yanni\u2019s \u201cIn My Time\u201d era \u2013 graceful, smooth, and melodic. \u201cLone Walk\u201d is a favorite. Darker and more melancholy, this one reminds me of Dax Johnson in places. Piano, strings, and percussion are evocative and moody. \u201cIn-Side Change\u201d is also on the dark, pensive side, and voices join the instrumental mix. It\u2019s a beautiful piece, but I\u2019m not crazy about the solo violin (keyboard). \u201cNocturne No. 2\u201d takes a more classical turn and is solo piano. I really like \u201cSecret Life,\u201d which also has hints of Yanni. Upbeat and rhythmic, it is one of the more joyous pieces on the album. \u201cWater Dance\u201d is another favorite. A bit more ambient for the first two minutes, the haunting flute casts a quiet spell. Then the piano comes in, swirling and dancing. Eventually, the flute returns along with strings, creating a joyous celebration.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCascades\u201d is a strong and promising first album from Arturo Mayorga, a musician who obviously loves what he\u2019s doing. It is available from www.arturomayorga.com, cdbaby.com, amazon.com (download), and iTunes.
