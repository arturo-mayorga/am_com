The 10 tracks feature keyboards and strings that just soar, and will easily carry you along for the journey. When you listen to the strings supporting his keyboard on the opener, \u201cSunrise\u201d, you\u2019ll fall in love with his talent immediately\u2026 he doesn\u2019t rush his playing at all, or burden your ears with over-emotive lines that often ruin a \u201cNew Age\u201d album for me\u2026 full of the spirit of loveliness. This debut CD came to be as he began production on something entirely different, and that natural flow is evident through all the pieces\u2026 the only note I would offer for future albums would be to add some live percussion \u2013 not that the percussives are \u201cbad\u201d, it\u2019s just evident that they would sound more natural if live. He also offers up some strong dynamics &amp; high energy on my favorite original, \u201cA Secret Life\u201d\u2026 full-bodied and definitely forward-looking. I give this one a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and will certainly look forward to his next effort. \u201cEQ\u201d (energy quotient) rating is 4.1.

However if he were to attempt this feat, I am certain it would be as graceful and dignified as what I have heard in his first classic New Age piano CD.<\/p>\n<p>Equal to his talents as a composing musician, Arturo Mayorga is nationally ranked in the competitive sport of Ballroom dancing, where Waltz, Tango, and Swing are scrutinized before watchful judges who watch for the accepted criteria of a dancing couple locked hand in hand. Now with a concert piano as his partner, Cascades embraces the identical movements found in classical dance by having a choreography timed with proper speed, motion, and balance.<\/p>\n<p>Like so many musicians, a parent\u2019s considerate gift of a musical instrument at an early age is what began his interest in music. Arturo states that it was at this early age that he realized the impact of what one person playing an instrument could have on another. Arturo continued music through high school then college. His scholastic studies were in math and science, but composing music was also on his mind so he started the framework songs for the Cascades album during this time period. While judging this CD for myself, I found the 10 classic piano songs of varying moods left me feeling they were a personal revelation of his emotional thoughts put to music.<\/p>\n<p>Cascades begins with first song Sunrise. This mid tempo piano and violin duet sets the standard for a graceful heartfelt ballet, where each timed movement is balanced by the piano melody considering violin takes a second seat by following the lead. There is much emotional content since a melancholy feel is present, lending to a touch of sadness, yet adding character and definition, leaving a beautiful image of what you have just heard in your mind.<\/p>\n<p>The Last Night of Winter aligns well with the piano\u2019s duo partner in allowing violin to take the lead in portion of the melody during this faster paced song, where full 360 degree rotational dance pivots, and those brief stationary pauses always see during pivot turns, can be pictured in your mind if you try.\nThe title song Cascades is a true champion in freestyle, where a faster tempo piano promenades with every rise and fall in piano key note steps, reaching the full height in posture, rhythm, and speed.<\/p>\n<p>Violin notes then connects with the melody posturing in a more formal manner while piano strokes sweep along the keyboard at a dizzying pace. The positive upbeat piano movements seem to sweep you off your feet at critical moments, leaving you breathless at the finish.<\/p>\n<p>Arturo is successful at engraving a full range of emotional content and movement into his classic orchestra style music. Cascades is a wonderful piano and instrumental album with beautiful rhythm.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing Arturo Mayorga\u2019s background in dance, one can easily imagine themselves sitting in the audience watching him in motion while listening to his music. From where I happen to be sitting, Arturo appears to be a winner.\"<\/p>","excerpt":"<p>\u201cArturo Mayorga is recognized as a dancing pianist but don\u2019t get me wrong, Arturo does not literally dance while playing piano.
