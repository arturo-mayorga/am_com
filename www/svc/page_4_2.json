Arturo Mayorga is a pianist\/keyboard player and composer based in New York, and I am assuming he is of Latin origin. Lucid Dreams is his new album of instrumental music \u2013 there is a vocalist <a href=\"http:\/\/www.danielehager.com\" title=\"www.danielehager.com\" target=\"_blank\">[the ethereal Daniele Hager]<\/a> involved but it is of the lyric-less accompaniment and adds an diaphanous element to the music. Now, as for the music itself, I guess you may want to call it \u2018New Age\u2019 for want of a better description, but I feel Contemporary Instrumental or even Contemporary Classical is a more fitting and apt description. The music, spread over eleven tracks, is melodically rich and utilises woodwind and strings to accompany Mr Mayorga\u2019s keyboards. Guitar and drums add more colour and occasional flashes of rhythm. There too many musicians involved to mention them by name in this space, but the musicianship and commitment is high and the sound is very special. The music doesn\u2019t feel like it fits a time or space within any musical genre \u2013 it does have a dreamlike aspect to it though. And it reminds me a little of the music of the British musician Richard Wileman and his band Karda Estra. Both of these composers eschew rock or pop pastiche and have developed their own musical language to the point where the musical language is unique. I think Mr Mayorga\u2019s music is arguably a little smoother in style. The eleven tracks are: Find Me Again, Mystery, Looking, Serendipity, <a href=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/?p=373\" title=\"Eastern Pulse \u2013 Tango\">Eastern Pulse<\/a>, Reflejos, You Know It\u2019s You, One More Day, Latent Words, Within A Glimpse, If We Don\u2019t Who Will? Lucid Dreams is an album that grows on the listener through repeated playing and is quality throughout. Highly Recommended.<\/p>\n<p>For more information about this artist, album and availability visit: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arturomayorga.com\" title=\"www.arturomayorga.com\">www.arturomayorga.com<\/a><\/p>","excerpt":"<p\/><img src=\"http:\/\/arturomayorga.com\/site\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/05\/183-6794075-6600956-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Lucid Dreams - Cover Art\" title=\"Lucid Dreams - Cover Art\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-393\" height=\"150\" width=\"150\">\u201cThis CD arrived without any kind of press kit of background information, so I hope the assumptions I make in describing this album are...","title":"Lucid Dreams review by John M Peters","id":389,"url":"?p=389","categories":[{"id":0},{"id":4},{"id":5}]},{"content":"<p><a href=\"http:\/\/zzaj.freehostia.com\/Z97Reviews.htm\">Quoted<\/a> text below:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat an apt description for the beautiful music Arturo has created for your ears and your spirit. The 10 tracks feature keyboards and strings that just soar, and will easily carry you along for the journey. When you listen to the strings supporting his keyboard on the opener, \u201cSunrise\u201d, you\u2019ll fall in love with his talent immediately\u2026 he doesn\u2019t rush his playing at all, or burden your ears with over-emotive lines that often ruin a \u201cNew Age\u201d album for me\u2026 full of the spirit of loveliness. This debut CD came to be as he began production on something entirely different, and that natural flow is evident through all the pieces\u2026 the only note I would offer for future albums would be to add some live percussion \u2013 not that the percussives are \u201cbad\u201d, it\u2019s just evident that they would sound more natural if live. He also offers up some strong dynamics &amp; high energy on my favorite original, \u201cA Secret Life\u201d\u2026 full-bodied and definitely forward-looking. I give this one a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and will certainly look forward to his next effort. \u201cEQ\u201d (energy quotient) rating is 4.1.
