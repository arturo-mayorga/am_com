Most of the ten tracks are piano with keyboard orchestration and embellishments, and several indicate a strong influence from Yanni. There is a variety of moods in the pieces \u2013 some are soft and romantic while others are darker and more powerful \u2013 indicating that Mayorga has a good range of styles. \u201cCascades\u201d is a very strong debut even though it is a little heavy on the synth strings.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSunrise\u201d begins the album with a hushed sense of mystery. As the piece evolves, it becomes more colorful and melodic while maintaining a mood of calm optimism. The title track picks up the tempo a bit. The left hand plays a flowing accompaniment to the lovely melody while gentle percussion and string washes in the background add dimension. \u201cPainting On Silence\u201d has a very strong influence from Yanni\u2019s \u201cIn My Time\u201d era \u2013 graceful, smooth, and melodic. \u201cLone Walk\u201d is a favorite. Darker and more melancholy, this one reminds me of Dax Johnson in places. Piano, strings, and percussion are evocative and moody. \u201cIn-Side Change\u201d is also on the dark, pensive side, and voices join the instrumental mix. It\u2019s a beautiful piece, but I\u2019m not crazy about the solo violin (keyboard). \u201cNocturne No. 2\u201d takes a more classical turn and is solo piano. I really like \u201cSecret Life,\u201d which also has hints of Yanni. Upbeat and rhythmic, it is one of the more joyous pieces on the album. \u201cWater Dance\u201d is another favorite. A bit more ambient for the first two minutes, the haunting flute casts a quiet spell. Then the piano comes in, swirling and dancing. Eventually, the flute returns along with strings, creating a joyous celebration.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCascades\u201d is a strong and promising first album from Arturo Mayorga, a musician who obviously loves what he\u2019s doing. It is available from www.arturomayorga.com, cdbaby.com, amazon.com (download), and iTunes.
