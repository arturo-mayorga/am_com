“What an apt description for the beautiful music Arturo has created for your ears and your spirit. The 10 tracks feature keyboards and strings that just soar, and will easily carry you along for the journey. When you listen to the strings supporting his keyboard on the opener, “Sunrise”, you’ll fall in love with his talent immediately… he doesn’t rush his playing at all, or burden your ears with over-emotive lines that often ruin a “New Age” album for me… full of the spirit of loveliness. This debut CD came to be as he began production on something entirely different, and that natural flow is evident through all the pieces… the only note I would offer for future albums would be to add some live percussion – not that the percussives are “bad”, it’s just evident that they would sound more natural if live. He also offers up some strong dynamics & high energy on my favorite original, “A Secret Life”… full-bodied and definitely forward-looking. I give this one a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, and will certainly look forward to his next effort. “EQ” (energy quotient) rating is 4.1.
